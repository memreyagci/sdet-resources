2.Design 			Req. docs.				Architecture			Design doc (SDS)

3.Coding/Devel.		PO&designer docs.		Developers				code --> to build SW

4.Testing			Req doc & SW			Testers					code --> to test SW

5.Production		bug free SW				End-users				End-users use the app

6.Maintenance		Client updates			all first 4 steps		Deploy a new version of the app by repeating SDLC --> therefore it is a life cycle
