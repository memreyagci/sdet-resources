***Some Keypoints of Working On JIRA: (WHILE DOING "MANUAL TESTING")

	1-Always remember, there are always "developers" as our team mates in the Scrum Team
	2-We will work with them on the same JIRA board but using different columns
	3-After they developed and deployed the US to our QA Environment 
	4-You will be assigned a US to test and it already includes some ACs created by PO

===> Our active job starts in here;

	5-We and even the developers will have "only some screenshots" related to the USs
	6-These screenshots are created by the designers "in the second phase of SDLC" (Desinging phase)
	7-There will be no ready application in front of us in the real work environment.

	8-For that reason, "first of all, you should analyse your US (feature or functionality) carefully"
	9-By putting yourself in the end-users, you should create "your scenarios" including the 
	  "positive and negative" ones covering all the possibilities to verify the functionality properly

	  		REMEMBER => !!! YOU WILL BE FINDING MOST OF THE BUGS WHİLE DOİNG "NEGATİVE TESTING" !!!

	10-Based on your scenarios you will start to write your Test Cases

	  
	***TestCase Creation in JIRA: 

	  							*Easy and simple to understand
	  							*Adjustable to any test data related to the same functionality
	  							*Strictly based on the Requirements of the application

	  !!!Syntax and Text part:!!!

	  		1-Actions => ***Each small action that we take on UI to reach our verification point 
	  					 will correspond to our one seperate step  

	  		   *Use "directive statement" in general for each test step action part
	  		  But just for the Last Step, since it will be your verifying point for the functionality;
	  		   *Use "Verify that user can ..." structure

	  		2-Expected Result => Use "User should be able to see/click/add ...."
                                  "System should be able to display the message ...."

         3-Test Data: => Please carefully determine "which data will be your test data"
                                                      "in which specific test step"

            	For instance: 
            	         1-If you test navigate a page directly => url  
            	         2-If you login and fill out the related input boxes => username and password
            	         3-If you create/delete/remove/add any file to favorite => the file name

            	         			will be your TEST DATA...

      !!! Linking Issues are really important for the JIRA TİCKETS !!!


		!!! You will create only one Test Execution Ticket for each User Story
